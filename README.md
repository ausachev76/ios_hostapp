# ios_hostApp
The "hostApp" folder contains project files for the host-application. These project files are used for launching and deploying your iOS Feature. Normally there is no need to change these files.

The "_REPLACE_MODULE_NAME_" folder contains files and folders of the project that serves as a template for your iOS Feature. This is the place where you will allocate your source code.

The "userContent" folder is used to store a user-generated content (images, audio files, text files, configuration files, etc.) that is required for the Feature you develop. Once your Feature is compiled, the ready-to-use static library will be allocated into this folder.
